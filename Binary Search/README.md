# Binary Search
Given an array of numbers called `numberList` which is sorted in ascending order, and a `target`, write a function to search `target` in `numberList`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.


This code is written based on the challenge mentioned in: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)


## Examples
### Example 1:
Input: `numberList{-1,0,3,5,9,12}, target = 9`

Output: `4`

Explanation: `9 exists in numberList and its index is 4`

### Example 2:
Input: `numberList{-1,0,3,5,9,12}, target = 2`

Output: `-1`

Explanation: `2 does not exist in numberList so return -1`


## Instructions
Do `g++ -Wall -std=c++17 binaryGap.cpp` and then `./a.out`.
